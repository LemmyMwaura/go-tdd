# Overview

This repository contains the code and tests I've written while re-learning Go programming language with a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach. Each directory corresponds to a specific concept or exercise covered during my learning journey. This README provides guidance on how to navigate and utilize the resources within this repository.

## Prerequisites

Before exploring this repository, ensure that you have Go installed on your machine. You can download and install Go from the [official Go website](https://golang.org/).

### Getting Started

To explore the code and tests in this repository:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Desired Section**: Inside the repository, navigate to the directory corresponding to the concept or exercise you are interested in.

3. **Read the Code and Tests**: Each directory contains Go source code files (.go) and test files (\_test.go). Read through the code and accompanying tests to understand how different Go concepts are applied.

4. **Run Tests**: After making changes or exploring the code, run the tests using the `go test` command to ensure that the code behaves as expected.

### Example

Here's a simplified example of exploring a concept within this repository:

1. **Navigate to Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd <directory-name>
   ```

2. **Read Code and Tests**:
